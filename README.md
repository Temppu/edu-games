1) SpellingWordGame
	
	The SpellingWordGame is simply played. You input a list of ten spelling words into
	the program, and it will pick one randomly. You are then challenged to guess what
	word the program picked! You are scored based on how quick you guess the word and
	your highest score is tracked in a file kept in the same folder as the executable.

	Not all inputs are sanitzed, so have fun giving the game numbers instead of words
	and the like.
